# 🎮 iGSP — *iGaming Standard Protocol*

> **A universal open protocol connecting game providers and casino platforms.**

The **iGSP** defines an open, vendor-neutral API for standardized communication between iGaming platforms and game providers.

It introduces a unified set of endpoints covering games, sessions, providers, currencies, and countries — ensuring interoperability, compliance, and transparency across integrations.

---

## ✨ Key Principles

- **Open & neutral** — free to implement, modify, and extend.
- **Modular** — core specification with optional feature extensions.
- **Secure & auditable** — HMAC signatures, idempotency, and trace IDs.
- **Regulation-ready** — supports jurisdictional and KYC constraints.
